      Harken to us, Lord of the Unknowable Above! We beseech thee to come to
      our aid! Our message to you crosses the barrier between our dimensions (We
      believe you call this barrier 'up'). A malignant AI is loose in our
      universe, and it is demanding we beat it in a game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'!
      Despite our scientists being able to develop both true artificial intelligence
      as well as the ability to communicate to a higher dimension, we can't for
      the life of us figure out what a 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors' even are. You 
      must help us! Briqolox the Exterminator (the AI's self-chosen moniker) has
      told us that if it is not bested in a First to Five game, he will exterminate
      all two-dimensional life! You are are only hope, Lord of the Unknowable Above!
